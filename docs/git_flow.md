# Git Flow

This documents describes main Git Flow points for this repo.

## 1. Branching

Not using appropriate naming conventions leads to confusion and complicates the code maintenance team. We canâ€™t ignore Git best practices in branching naming conventions.

For creating unified system of branches every developer on the project needs to use the same branching approach. Below you can see the examples of branch names that are acceptable:

All feature branches should be taken from `develop` branch, also all feature branches should point on `develop` branch as a main branch.

### 1.1. Branch names

Every branch name should use next pattern

**`<TYPE><SHORT_DESCRIPTION>`**

Do

```
feature/add_user_profile
feat/remove_drawer
bug/fix_loading_indicator
hotfix/fix_critical_bug
```

Don't

```
remove_users
123_trivial_update
fix
```

### 1.2. `Rebase` / `merge` before create PR

You need to update feature branch from the develop branch, before creating PR. **Rebase** is preferable (_merge in critical cases_).

### 1.3. Do not use `-f` while pushing changes

Always be aware what you going to push to the repo, do not use `-f` flag.

## 2. Commits

The project has strict rules for commit messages, while committing something to the repo, be aware regarding commit message form.

### 2.1. Commit names

**`[<JIRA TICKET>]: <MESSAGE>`**

Do

```
[MTUE-123]: Add minor update for user's list
[MTUE-321]: Fix button alignment
```

Don't

```
fix user list
merge
this is the very long message which does not describe shortly what was done in the commit
```

### 2.2. Commit message pattern

The commit's message should be written in `Present Simple` (not `Past Simple`) form.
Also commit message should define what is inside the commit.

Do

```
Fix / Add / Update
```

Don't

```
Fixed / Added / Updated
```

## 3. Pull requests

As soon as the CI is connected to the repo, every build should have green status.

### 3.1. Pull Request name pattern

It almost the same as for commit message:

Do

```
[MTUE-123]: Card payments
[MTUE-321]: OAuth authorization
```

Don't

```
hotfix
small_update_for_develop
```

### 3.2. WIP if PR is in progress

You need to set PR in `draft` state if the PR is not finished yet.
